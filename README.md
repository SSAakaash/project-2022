# Lock - A Password Manager

NCFE Class 12 2022 Project

Synopsis:

‘Lock – A Password Manager’ is a password manager written completely in Python and is designed to run on 
the command line. 
It uses a master password to encrypt and store login details such as usernames and passwords in a MySQL database. 
The master password is hashed and stored in a hidden text file. 
It allows for creating, editing, storing and displaying all the login details in a safe and secure manner. 
It also allows for copying of username or password to clipboard.

PyCharm, MySQL, PyCryptodome, Pyperclip and Tabulate were used in making the project.
